                <p>First and foremost, the DGU wants the program to increase member retention among all participating clubs. Specifically, the goal is to grow member retention by 10 percent. A separate goal is that clubs participating in the program improve significantly with regards to integrating and retaining new members.</p>
                <p>Also, the program aims to grow the number of members that will actually recommend a particular club to potential new players. This will mean that participating clubs should see an influx of new players.</p>
                <p>It is expected that the Players 1st program will grow the number of golfers in Denmark by 10-15 percent over the next three years. If that happens, it will mean a significant economic boost to the golf clubs in Denmark.</p>
